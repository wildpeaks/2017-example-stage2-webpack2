# Boilerplate: ES Modules, Stage 2, Webpack.

Boilerplate for **Webapps** that use **ES Modules** and stage2 **Class Properties**.


## NPM Scripts

The following commands are available:
 - **start**: Starts the Webpack Dev Server
 - **build**: Generate production bundles of `/src/entry.js` to `/www` folder
 - **analyze**: Generates production bundles, and opens Webpack Bundle Analyzer
 - **lint**: Eslint the `/src` folder


## Visual Studio Code

Once you have Webpack Dev Server running (using `npm start`), open the VSCode debugger.
It is already setup to open http://localhost:8000, so you get both *remote debugging* and *livereload*.
